# Charity Minds

Idea by @Arylide fullstack dev class 2025

Charity Minds is a web platform designed to coordinate and streamline charity visits to children's homes. The platform aims to ensure that all kids' homes, including small and lesser-known ones, receive equal attention and support from groups and volunteers.

## Problem Statement

Often, some children's homes receive frequent visits and donations, while others are overlooked. This leads to inequality in support and resources. Charity Minds addresses this by providing a transparent and collaborative platform where:

- Groups and volunteers can post about their planned or completed visits to specific kids' homes.
- The community can see which homes have been recently visited and which ones need more attention.
- Small and unknown kids' homes are highlighted to encourage more balanced support.

## Key Features

- **Post Visits:** Groups and volunteers can log their visits to any kids' home, sharing details and photos.
- **Home Directory:** A comprehensive list of kids' homes, including lesser-known ones, with profiles and needs.
- **Visit Calendar:** Visualize recent and upcoming visits to each home to avoid over-visitation or neglect.
- **Notifications:** Get alerts about homes that haven't been visited in a while or have urgent needs.
- **Equality Focus:** Tools to promote visits to under-supported homes.

## How It Works

1. **Register/Login:** Users create an account as a group or individual volunteer.
2. **Browse Homes:** View all registered kids' homes, their profiles, and visitation history.
3. **Map View:** Visualize the locations of all kids' homes on an interactive map to easily identify under-visited or nearby homes.
4. **Post a Visit:** Log details of a visit, including date, group, and activities.
5. **Plan Visits:** See which homes need attention and schedule your next visit accordingly.
6. **Track Impact:** Monitor the distribution of visits and support across all homes.
